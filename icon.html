        <p>The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to
             produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then
              ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out,
               producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
                Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
                 caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk,
                  and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.</p>
